=====

One of the Data Preproccessing Layers that is mostly not useful for anything not Particle Physics related, since it assumes the Input to be a list of lists of Momentum 4 vectors.
Is Outdatet, buggy and only here for consistency


Arguments

* **gs**: The Number of Particles used, will become the Number of Nodes (Graph size)

* **numericC=10000**: A Numerical Constant that will be sometimes used to keep things finite


Produced Features

* E

* p1

* p2

* p3

* eta

* phi

* m

* pt (transverse momentum)

* p (absolute Value of the Momentum 3 vector)

* iszero (a flag to filter out missing(zero) particles)
