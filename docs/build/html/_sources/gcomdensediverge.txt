gcomdensediverge
================

Inputs a 3d Vector of dimensions (-1,gs,param) and uses a simple dense Layer to transform it into (-1,gs,c,paramo) without breaking Graph Permutation Symmetry.
So transforms each Feature Vector into a set of c Feature Vectors.

Arguments

* **gs**: The Number of Nodes of the Graph (Graph Size)

* **param**: The Number of Features for each node

* **paramo**: The Number of Features each Outputvector should have

* **c=2**: The Number of Outputvectors for each Inputfeaturevector

* **initializer=glorot_uniform**: THe Transformation initializer

* **learnabel=True**: Shall the Transformation be learnable
