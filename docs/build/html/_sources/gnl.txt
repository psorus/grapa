a function to just add some graph update functionality without relearning the graph, defined by m.graph*. Can use usei to use inverted Graph update layers instead of the normal ones (to make invertibility easier). Also understands alin (iarities) as a vector

Arguments:

* **g**: a grap object

* **m**: a constant object (generated for example by getm())

* **alin=[]**: alinearity used, defined in glm

* **iterations=1**: run each graph update step iteration times (one layer)

* **repeat=1**: repeat this function repeat times (multiple layers)

* **usei=False**: use inverse graph update layers



Returns:

* **g**: the updated grap object
