gsym
====

Symmetrises a Adjacency Matrix, by adding the Transposed Matrix to it and rounding it (rounding is simplified by setting the Numerical constant to a low fixed Value of 5). You could understand this as a connection A_ij is one, if either A_ij or A_ji is one.

Arguments

* **gs**: The Number of Nodes of the Graph (Graph Size)
