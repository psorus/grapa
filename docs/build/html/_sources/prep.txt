prep
====

Runs my standart Input preparation. Probably not useful except for physics
(create an Input, gpre5 on it and optionally use norm (decided by m.prenorm))

Arguments:

* **g**: a grap object, already containing gs and param in the state object s

* **m**: a constant object (generated for example by getm())
