gcomdepoollg
============

Extension of gcomdepool by also learning a Graph. Breaks Graph Permutation Symmetry, by using a Dense layer to create a c*c Adjacency Matrix from all features. Returns the Feature Vectors and the Adjacency Matrices

Arguments

* **gs**: The initial Number of Nodes of the Graph (Graph Size)

* **param**: The initial Number of Features for each node

* **paramo**: The Number of Features each Outputvector should have

* **c=2**: The Factor by which to increase gs

* **metrik_init=glorot_uniform**: The Transformation initializer to go from little Feature Vector to output Vectors

* **graph_init=keras.initializers.Identity()**: The Initializer to create the Graph

* **learnable=True**: Shall the Transformation be learnable
