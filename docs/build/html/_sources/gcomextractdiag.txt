Takes a 5 dimensional Tensor of size (-1,gs,gs,c,c) and transforms it into a 4d Tensor of size (-1,gs,c,c) by demanding that the second and third index are the same (A_ijklm into A_ijjlm)

Arguments

* **gs**: The Number of Nodes of the Graph (Graph Size).

* **c**: The Number of Nodes in each subgraph
