gcomgraphfrom2param
===================

Takes a 5d Tensor of size (-1,gs,gs,param,n) and transforms it into (-1,gs,gs,c,c). So basically creates a Graph of size c for each set of n param vectors, using a simple Dense Layer to do the (param,n) to (c,c) transformation.

Arguments

* **gs**: The Number of Nodes in each global Graph.

* **param**: The Number of Features from which the graphs will be constructed

* **c=2**: The Number of Nodes in each resulting subgraph.

* **n=2**: The Number of Feature Vectors that result in each subgraph

* **initializer="glorot_uniform"**: The initializer of the Transformation

* **trainable=True**: weather the Transformation is trainable
