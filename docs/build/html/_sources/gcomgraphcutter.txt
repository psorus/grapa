gcomgraphcutter
===============

Takes a Adjacency Matrix of size gs, cuts it into c subgraphs, and uses mode Transformation to combine those c subgraphs and rounded the Grahs afterwards.

Arguments

* **gs**: The initial Number of Nodes in the Graph.

* **c=2**: The Number of subgraphs, must gs must divide it.

* **mode**: either "mean","min" or "max". The kind of Transformation that combines the Graphs.

* **cut=0.5**: Where to round the graph after the mode transformation, Each Value above cut will be set to 1 and each value below to 0, each Value that is equal to cut will be also set to 1

* **c_const=1000**: Since the Rounding is implementet using relus (relu(1+c_const*(X-cut))-relu(c_const*(X-cut))) , you require a numerical constant to decide how fast the rounding function goes from 0 to 1. This could be set higher, but this could result in diverging gradients.
