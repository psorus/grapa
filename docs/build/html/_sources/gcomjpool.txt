=========

Takes a Feature Vector of size (-1,gs,param) and some indices representing order indices (-1,gs) and uses these indices to reorders the Feature Vectors and applies a simple Dense Transformation to transform it into (-1,gs/c,paramo)

Arguments

* **gs**: The initial Number of Nodes in each Graph.

* **param**: The initial Number of Features.

* **c=2**: How many Feature Vectors to combine into each Outputvector. gs has to divide this

* **paramo**: The Number of Features in each Outputvector

* **metrik_init="glorot_uniform"**: The initializer of the Transformation

* **trainable=True**: weather the Transformation is trainable
