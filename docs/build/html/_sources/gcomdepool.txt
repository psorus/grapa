==========

Transforms a 3d Vector (-1,gs,param) into a 4d vector (-1,gs,c,paramo) using a Dense Layer. It respects Graph Permutation Symmetry by simply transforming each Feauture Vector into a List of c Feature Vectors

Arguments

* **gs**: The initial Number of Nodes of the Graph (Graph Size)

* **param**: The initial Number of Features for each node

* **paramo**: The Number of Features each Outputvector should have

* **c=2**: The Factor by which to increase gs

* **metrik_init=glorot_uniform**: The Transformation initializer to go from little Feature Vector to output Vectors

* **learnable=True**: Shall the Transformation be learnable
