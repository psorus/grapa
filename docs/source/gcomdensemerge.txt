gcomdensemerge
==============

Takes a 4d Tensor (-1,gs,ags,param) and transforms it using a simple Dense Layer into a 3d one (-1,gs,paramo). Respects Graph permutation Symmetry. So Basically Transforms each set of vectors into one vector of different size

Arguments

* **gs**: The Number of Lists of Feature Vectors and the Number of Nodes in the Output

* **ags**: The Number of Vectors in each List of Input vector, could be understood as the opposite of c

* **param**: The Number of Features for each Input Node

* **paramo**: The Number of Features each Outputvector should have

* **initializer=glorot_uniform**: The Transformation initializer

* **learnabel=True**: Shall the Transformation be learnable
