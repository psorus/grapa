========

Orders a Feature vector of size (-1,gs,param), orders it by its last Feature and uses a simple Dense Layer to transform each c neighbouring Feature Vectors into one Feature Vector of size paramo (-1,gs/c,paramo)

Arguments

* **gs**: The initial Number of Nodes in each Graph.

* **param**: The initial Number of Features in each Node.

* **paramo**: The Number of Features in each output Node.

* **c=2**: How many Input Feature Vectors are to be transformed into one Output Vector

* **metrik_init="glorot_uniform"**: Initializer of the Transformation

* **learnable=True**: Weather the Transformation is learnable.
