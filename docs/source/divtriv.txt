=======

trivial graph diverger by a factor of c (does not chance param at all)
  requiregp=True: require ggoparam at the start
    addDense: intermediate Dense Layers, sizes between 1 and c useful
Best handled decompress

Arguments:

* **g**: a grap object

* **c**: the abstraction factor

* **m**: a constant object (generate for example by getm())

* **shallgp**: if the input is 3 dimensional, set this to true. if it is already 2 dimensional (since graphatbottleneck) set it to false

* **addDense=[[]]**: intermediate Dense layer sizes

* **activation**: activation of the dense layers


Returns:

* **g**: the updated grap object
