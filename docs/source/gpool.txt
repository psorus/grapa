gpool
=====

Simple Pooling Layer. Allows you to reduce a 3 dimensional Tensor (-1,gs,param) into (-1,param) by running a Pooling Operation on each Node. Is the simplest way to finish a classical Graph Network that does not break Graph Permutation Symmetry



Arguments

* **gs**: The Number of Nodes of the Graph (Graph Size)

* **param**: The Number of Features for each Node

* **mode="max"**: Pooling Operation, either "max","mean" or "sum"
