glkeep
======

Version of glm to handle concatted Graphs. Works with the first of (dimension+1) Adjacency Matrices.


Arguments

* **gs**: The gs Number of Nodes of the Graph (Graph Size)

* **param**: The Number of Features for each node in the Feature Vector

* **a**: Size of the abstraction, think of this as the size of a second batch simension

* **iterations=1**: repeat the Actions of this Layer iterations time

* **alinearity=[-1.0,1.0]**: activation of this Layer, explained better in glm

* **kernel_initializer="glorot_uniform"**: Initializer of this Layer

* **self_initializer=None**: Instead of using kernel_initializer, this can be used to specify an initializer just for the self interaction of this Layer. Has preference over kernel_initializer.

* **neig_initializer=None**: Instead of using kernel_initializer, this can be used to specify an initializer just for the neighbour interaction of this Layer. Has preference over kernel_initializer

* **learnable=True**: weather this Layer has learnable Variables (self and neighbour interaction). Useful for debugging sometimes

* **dimension=0**: Number of additional Adjacency Matrices
