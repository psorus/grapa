Grapa: Graph Autoencoder for tensorflow
=======================================

A simple python3 library using keras and tensorflow to do Deep Learning on Graphs, with a strong emphasis on Codes that chance the Shape of the Graph in a way that can be used for Autoencoder

We split our Code into two different Apis: a low level Layer Api, and a high Level Functional Api. We also provide 5 different example Applications to get you started using grapa as fast as possible.
