gpoolgrowth
===========

Takes a List of Featurevectors for one Node (-1,param) and the old Feature vector, to learn from this 2d Vector (out-inn) new nodes (using a 1 layer dense), that are concattet to the old Featurevector and returned


Arguments

* **inn**: The initial Number of Nodes of the Graph (Graph Size)

* **out**: The resulting Number of Nodes of the Graph (Graph Size)

* **param**: The Number of Features for each Node

* **kernel_initializer=glorot_uniform**: The initializer of the Transformation
