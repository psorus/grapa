gltrivmlp
=========

Copy of glmlp but with a trivial update procedure (cut to the desired size). Sometimes useful for debugging

Arguments

* **gs**: The gs Number of Nodes of the Graph (Graph Size)

* **param**: The Number of Features for each node in the Feature Vector

* **keepconst**: The first keepconst Features are keept unchanced

* **iterations=1**: repeat the Actions of this Layer iterations time

All remaining Parameters can be given, but have no effect

* **alinearity=[-1.0,1.0]**: activation of this Layer, explained better in glm

* **initializer="glorot_uniform"**: Initializer of this Layer

* **i1**: Size after the first Dense Layer

* **i2**: Size after the second Dense Layer

* **mlpact=K.relu**: Activation after each Dense Update Step. Requires to be a function

* **momentum=0.99**: Momentum of the BatchNormalisation

* **k=16**: Number of Average Connections in the Graph. Can be ignored, and is ignored in glm, but migth help the Network converge
