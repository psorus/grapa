gpre3
=====

One of the Data Preproccessing Layers that is mostly not useful for anything not Particle Physics related, since it assumes the Input to be a list of lists of Momentum 4 vectors.
Is Outdatet, buggy and only here for consistency

The only chance to gpre2 is the position of the flag

Arguments

* **gs**: The Number of Particles used, will become the Number of Nodes (Graph size)

* **numericC=10000**: A Numerical Constant that will be sometimes used to keep things finite


Produced Features

* iszero (a flag to filter out missing(zero) particles)

* eta-mean(eta)

* phi-mean(phi)

* ln(pt)

* ln(E)

* -ln(pt/sum(pt))

* -ln(E/sum(E))

* sqrt((eta-mean(eta))**2+(phi-mean(phi))**2)
