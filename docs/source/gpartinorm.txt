gpartinorm
==========

Normalises each Feature in each Batch in a special way:
After subtracting the mean of each vector x, it subtracts the mean(abs(x)) from it, just to divide it by (mean(abs(x))+max(abs(x)))/2.



Arguments

* **gs**: The Number of Nodes of the Graph (Graph Size)

* **param**: The Number of Features in each Feature vector

* **alpha=0.01**: A numeric Constant to remove divergences from dividing (instead of 1/a it uses 1/(abs(a)+alpha))
